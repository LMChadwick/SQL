# Superstore SQL Analysis

This project contains basic SQL queries written as part of my learning journey in data analytics.

The dataset simulates a retail superstore with product information including category, price, stock, and rating.

## Queries Cover:

- Viewing the full table
- Ordering items by price
- Finding max price in a category
- Checking stock for specific items
- Using LIMIT to preview data

## Purpose:

This repository is part of my growing portfolio as I study SQL. I'm learning how to explore data using practical business questions.

More queries will be added as I progress in the course.
